# Blackjack

Blackjack is a game that involves at least one player competing against the dealer. Each participant is dealt two cards and the goal is to try and achieve the highest combined value with your cards without going over 21 (bust). Each number card has a value of that respective number, each face card is worth 10, and the ace is equal to 11 or 1 depending on the other cards the individual has. The dealer has a rule that they must continue to draw cards until they reach at least 17. They also start with one card face up and one card face down. It is up to the player to try and obtain a higher total than the dealer given that one card they can see from the dealer.

# Getting Started
Click here to play the game. 
Once loaded, cards will already be dealt to both you and the dealer. All you have to do is hit or stand depending on what you want to do. Good luck!

# Next Steps
- My original intention was to have the player place a bet to start the game, but we didn't have time for that... so implementing that would be my first priority.
- Adding a feature where the player can "split" their cards if they get a pair. 
- After betting is implemented, adding a feature where the player can "double down" and double their initial bet in exchange for only one additional card.
